        <h2>Review 2</h2>
        The Samsung Galaxy A8 (2018) replaces last year's Galaxy A5 (2017) in the Korean manufacturer's portfolio, which was, or still is, a successful smartphone. But the new model is more than just a normal intergenerational renewal.
        The Samsung Galaxy A8 (2018) goes a little higher. It's not a mid-range model, and it's not a flagship model either. The price aptly speaks volumes.
        The Samsung Galaxy A8 (2018) is perched in the gap between the mid-range and flagship segments, but perhaps it is closer to the flagship portfolio rather than the mid-range or upper mid-range.
        The Samsung Galaxy A8 (2018) is an excellent and relatively expensive smartphone. How it has proven itself in normal use and what positives and negatives it has, you will learn from the lines below.
        Design and finish: Packaging can sell a book and this will be true of the Galaxy A8 (2018) as well. The size is a bit bigger and the weight has also gone up (compared to last year's generation). Fortunately, these features are within ideal limits. The dimensions of the device are almost identical to the flagship Galaxy S8, and it is the closest in appearance to it. That is, if we take away the curvature of the display and the almost non-existent side edges, which are not to everyone's taste.
        The design and overall body workmanship is exemplary and flagship-like. Just as the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ are crafted, so is the Galaxy A8 (2018). The immensely solid and honest construction is enveloped by glass on both sides. However, fingerprints and dirt mark it virtually as soon as you take the device out of the package.
        The smartphone holds very well in the hand. But don't expect a perfect grip. The surface is slippery thanks to the glass, so you need to be careful. In school jargon, I would give it a commendable grade.
        If you leave the wild world of cafes or offices and happen to venture into the cautious outdoors or to a cottage, definitely buy a cover. So I visited Samsung's official website to check out some of the accessories. I didn't find any.
        There was none in the package either, not even a cheap clear plastic cover that would have served the purpose. Too bad. I got one for my cheap Motorola Moto M.
        The front is dominated by an excellent AMOLED display with an 18.5:9 aspect ratio, which probably helped the device's nice design the most. As I mentioned, the display is flat and thus has real side bezels. Who doesn't like the curved edges of flagship displays, the Galaxy A8 (2018) offers a really good solution.
        The fingerprint sensor has been moved to the back under the camera. I almost always palpated it with absolutely no problems. It is quite close to the optics and therefore can happen to touch it with a finger.
        Then you will be surprised by smudges in the photos, which are due to the lens cover glass getting clogged up. But the sensor works very quickly and reliably. Functionally, there is nothing to fault it.
        Neither the sensor nor the camera protrudes above the structure even by a micromillimeter. Great. The layout of the controls has remained unchanged. In the upper part of the right side there is the main button and above it the speaker. The volume controls are located at the top of the left side.
        I commend the responsiveness of the buttons. The Galaxy A8 (2018) doesn't have any tweezers that you'd be afraid to press harder. The buttons don't cut into your fingers and are simply as they should be.
        As for the sound, the speaker plays quite loud and reproduces the sound with an emphasis on depth and lower tones. I didn't observe a distinct tinny sound or even scratchy highs. Be warned, though, I wouldn't describe the sound as high quality. This is no BoomSound or Razer Phone solution. Far from it.
        Of course, there is a USB-C connector at the bottom of the device, next to which the audio jack found a place. I praise the two SIM card slots, which also accommodate a microSD card with a maximum capacity of 256 GB. The so-called DUOS version can be found in the free sale and in the O2 offer.
        Neither Orange nor Telekom will sell the dual SIM version.
        The Samsung Galaxy A8 (2018) is sold in black, gold and grey. Subjectively, the piano black finish suits it the most. Black is the frame of the design, as well as the segments for signal reception to the antennas.
        A big bonus is the IP68 level of protection, which I appreciated in the current winter season. I didn't exactly want to throw the Galaxy A8 (2018) into a drift of snow, but I did. Without consequence.
        Hardware: We mentioned a couple of components in the previous paragraph. The fingerprint scanner, buttons, and speaker are obvious. For the SIM slots, I'll add that they are sorted as follows. The socket at the top edge of the device can hold a SIM card and a microSD card. The additional socket number two is located in the middle of the left edge and contains one SIM slot.
        Beware, I only found 4G LTE connectivity with one of the two slots. The slot at the top edge of the device can only handle 2G/3G connectivity. Such a solution is offered by most dual SIM smartphones. But...I would have liked a dual LTE design, since it's 2018 and already our operators are slowly talking about 5G technology.
        Display: As the king of OLED displays, Samsung obviously did not disappoint. The excellent AMOLED display with 18.5:9 aspect ratio, 5.6-inch diagonal and FHD+ (1080 x 2220 px, 441 ppi) resolution leaves no room for any criticism. Exceptional contrast and vivid colors have not let up. The perfect black (pixel switching) I highlight always and always will.
        The native adaptive display settings suited me just fine. If it did, I might have dragged the slider towards warmer tones, which is understandably possible in the settings. A slightly cooler rendering may offend perfectionists.
        I compared the maximum and minimum brightness of the display with the flagship Samsung Galaxy S8+. I was expecting a compromise, but I didn't get one. The values are almost identical. So you can see what you need in direct sunlight and the display won't burn the retinas of your eyes in the evening. You activate the blue light filter directly from the notification bar.
        Since the Samsung Galaxy A8 (2018) is not a flagship, its display lacks the even finer QHD+ resolution. Personally, I didn't miss this luxury.
        Chipset: The design, the build and even the display shake hands with flagships except for a few minor details. However, the first serious difference is the chipset. I don't mean that the performance is lacking or that the smartphone is slow in normal usage. It doesn't.
        Only the more expensive flagships claim the status of sprinters and benchmark busters. The Exynos 7885 SoC has eight cores (2 x 2.2 GHz Cortex-A73 and 6 x 1.6 GHz Cortex-A53, 14nm) Mali-G71 graphics and 4 GB of RAM with 32 GB of storage.
        The processor's performance can handle any operation. It didn't struggle with anything. It handled more than an hour of torture with Into the Dead 2 without hesitation.
        The user difference over the flagship Exynos and Qualcomm chipsets? The game doesn't load in 2 seconds but in 7 seconds. Similarly with other more demanding operations. I had paper doubts about the performance at first, but I'm glad that practice has disproved them.
        The operating memory has sufficient capacity for full multitasking. After turning on the game, I switched to the YouTube app, launched two videos, then refreshed a couple of tabs in Chrome, continued with the Facebook and Instagram app.
        After reopening the game, it didn't reload and still remained active. However, after about an hour of playing and repeating the multitasking procedure, the game had to reload again. In doing so, I lost a justifiable 7 seconds of life that the reloading took away.
        I was using the 32 GB version of the smartphone. If the smartphone had already ventured into the upper mid-range, it should have had 64 GB of storage. There should be such a version, but whether it will be available in our market I don't know at the moment. Of the total memory, 7.6 GB was stolen by the operating system and the manufacturer's user interface, Samsung Experience.
        My demands always tip over 32 GB over time, although maybe not right away during the first weeks. I use cloud solutions quite heavily, and a 256 GB microSD card would throw me a lifeline in a few weeks and months, so max.
        Internal memory size requirements are individual.
        I was happy with the solid performance of the smartphone and didn't feel like I was missing any horses. Perhaps a better graphics chip would have suited the Exynos 7885 chipset better. For a better picture, I've also included the outputs from the leading testing apps AnTuTu and Geekbench.
        Is the latest Bluetooth 5.0 and NFC chip in the device as the initial speculations indicated? Twice yes.
        Cameras: The smartphone's main camera looks (on paper) amazing. Real-world experience hasn't convinced me that much. The main 16MP camera comes with a better aperture (upped from f/1.9 to f/1.7), which should ensure prettier images in low-light conditions.
        This feature is also helped by the larger pixel size (from 1.0µm to 1.12µm), which means more light will hit the pixels. The photos are beautiful, even in (only slightly) low light conditions. What they might say better, however, on a Samsung Galaxy S8 or perhaps a Note8, they don't.
        The difference is best noticed in the rendering of details. The images would benefit from more contrast and better colour reproduction. Even the fight with backlight is not always a winning one for the Samsung Galaxy A8 (2018). Sometimes less is more, and in really poor lighting conditions, where even flagship cameras would produce gloomy images, the system unnecessarily artificially brightens photos.
        So the result is admittedly a brighter image but with a load of noise, pixelation and almost no detail. The night photography was quite a surprise. However, occasional overexposure of the scene is unavoidable. There is a Night mode in the camera menu, which doesn't work miracles. It even does almost nothing, which you can see in the comparison of images in a separate article.
        Forget 4K video, too. The maximum is FHD 1080p resolution recording at 30 frames per second. The sensor uses digital image stabilization, which positively surprised me. The difference between stabilized and unstabilized video is noticeable. The comparison can be found again in a separate section. But the video quality does not impress.
        Please note that the stabilization does not work when shooting in 18.5:9 and 1:1 aspect ratios.
        Mobile photo geeks simply won't do at this address. They need to visit the flagship class. On the contrary, regular consumers will be satisfied, even their followers on social networks.
        But I have to write that I enjoyed shooting with the Galaxy A8 (2018). The camera app is excellent. I also liked the floating shutter button and zooming into the scene by sliding the button itself. The full view feature is excellent as well. It makes the camera environment use the entire display area, which makes shooting easier.
        You can shoot with the volume buttons, the auto HDR mode works well, there's no shortage of voice control or quick camera open by double-pressing the main button. 16MP images are only taken in 4:3 mode. For a wider 16:9 shot, you'll need to reduce the resolution to 12 Mpx.
        A fun feature called stickers is also present. You put dog or rabbit ears on the subject's head right from within the camera environment. The other intuitive option belongs to the Bixby Vision assistant, which recognizes the subjects you're shooting and looks up information about them online for you.
        You'll find something more useful if you swipe from left to right in the camera app. Use food mode in a well-lit restaurant. Panorama is great and works in the traditional way like on many other smartphones.
        Hypertime shooting needs a tripod and a nice natural scenery with clouds, lake or mountains for example. The timing is quite strict and for a nice timelapse you should shoot for at least an hour. I appreciate the possibility to transform the shots into a GIF animation.
        The failsafe is the professional mode. At first glance, it has everything. You set the light sensitivity, white balance, even metering and exposure compensation. At first I thought I was blind, but nowhere did I discover an option to manually control the shutter speed.
        This mode shouldn't be called professional or manual unless it allows manual shutter control. Especially when Samsung in the video ad talks about great night photos and shows the smartphone embedded in a large tripod. When shooting like this, you need and want to control the shutter speed.
        The main camera is pretty cool, you'll have fun taking pictures and you definitely won't be ashamed of your photos. However, it didn't get me out of my chair.
        For someone more important are the front cameras. According to Samsung, in this class of devices, quality selfie gear is in demand by users. That's why the slim top edge houses a straight pair of cameras.
        One has 16 megapixels and pixels as large as 1.0µm, the other has 8 megapixels and pixels as large as 1.12µm. The luminosity is identical - f/1.9. If you're a sucker for selfies, the Galaxy A8 (2018) has you covered. Ironically, the improvement over the last generation is most noticeable on the front and not on the rear camera.
        I liked the dynamic blur setting before the actual shooting. You can actually adjust it after the photo is taken. You can adjust the color rendition and the intensity of the software makeup or face smoothing. I liked the real-time effects, too.
        Seeing what a black and white photo will probably look like before it's taken is great. The dynamic blur, or bokeh, isn't as intense as, say, the Galaxy Note8, which is probably a good thing. It doesn't look so unnatural and artificial.
        Night mode also has a front-facing camera and can capture video in FHD 1080p resolution. You can get the full display potential by changing the setting to 18.5:9.
        I didn't get along with the Wide Selfie feature. This is a great feature, as it actually makes the photo wider, so you can fit a lot of things, or a lot of people, in the selfie shot. But you have to tilt the smartphone from side to side, which is inconvenient for the operator. While the software was willing to accept my left or right tilt, I had to repeat it several times.
        I immediately gave up on this way of shooting, as it started to get on my nerves after a while. By the time I got to the wide selfie I could have been photographed 8 times by passers-by with the rear camera.
        Lest I forget, the autofocus is accurate, it is good at evaluating where to focus. But the focusing speed is lazier.
        Software: I've already delved into the software section above, where I've broken down the cameras' features, not just their image quality. We'll continue with the other software benefits of the new sub-flagship model.
        Fans of the pure form of the Android operating system will be horrified. Samsung Experience version 8.5 is built by the manufacturer on top of 7.1.1 Nougat. The Oreo version will be delivered by an OTA update over time.
        Samsung Experience is the opposite of pure Android. Samsung's environment from
        The experience of using the environment is flagship. Essentially the same as if you were holding a Samsung Galaxy S8 in your hand. Samsung lets you customize a lot of details, which takes personalization to the next level.
        Carefully selected colors complement the various animations of the environment elements, which is pleasing to the eye. I like a device that I can constantly discover and customize. There are a lot of different settings and there is a problem with their clarity.
        However, there is a search box in the settings where you can type in approximately what you are looking for and you will definitely find your way around.
        I don't use the automatic brightness adjustment. So the system offered me the option of placing the brightness slider just below the main shortcuts in the notification bar. The slider is thus better at hand.
        You can set the home screen grid, power monitor, smart power on, gestures, blue light filter, display colour rendering, wallpapers, themes, multi-window display, hide software buttons, the excellent Always On Display feature... the list goes on for a few lines.
        I also like the "device maintenance" section. There you can see how the memory, security, storage and power consumption are doing. Any discrepancies can be addressed right there. E.g. excessive discharging by a particular application, removal of unnecessary data, etc.
        Players will be pleased with the so-called Game Launcher. You can turn off notifications during gameplay, set high performance, turn on screen recording in FHD resolution and stretch the game to the full 18.5:9 screen. Great for.
        You can also use the screen stretch when watching YouTube videos. Simply swipe two fingers away from each other across the screen, the video will stretch to 18.5:9 and you'll be able to use the full potential of the display.
        But sometimes that's a problem. The video is slightly cropped when stretched. On average, out of ten videos, the cropping bothered me on three occasions. Mostly because of text or subtitles in the video. But it all depends on the type of content and the specific video. You can see a comparison of views below.
        The device will offer you to sign in to your Samsung account. Should you be going to this brand for the first time, be sure to create an account. It will open up the price to useful features. There's the Bixby digital assistance that came from the flagship, which you won't be able to use without a Samsung account.
        That goes for the secure folder, a great tool for complete device backups, and also the Galaxy Apps store. Samsung has traditionally had the nicest weather app with a widget as well, and you even have the currently trending facial recognition device unlocking on hand.
        As in all similar, more or less perfect solutions, the recognition is not reliable enough for me to be willing to use it. It fails in the dark, in the car in the early evening, it takes a split second to point it at you.
        Fingerprint is my primary security, which I combine with PIN. I have a request. If I enter the last digit of the PIN correctly, let the smartphone unlock immediately without me having to tap the OK button unnecessarily.
        As for pre-installed ballast, you can find Microsoft apps in the menu. If you don't use them, you're out of luck. They can't be uninstalled. But you can put the apps to sleep. Hold your finger on any app icon and you'll see another menu with more settings.
        The Samsung Galaxy A8 (2018) will ask you if you want to install the manufacturer's court apps like Samsung Email, Browser, etc. before setting up the environment for the first time. So, it's up to you to decide if you'll be bothered by them on the apps screen.
        Samsung will give you a complete flagship software package with the Galaxy A8 (2018) that's good-looking, snappy, stable, and highly customizable.
        Endurance: the smartphone's battery life is unexceptional. It can handle one full productive day even with some of that margin. I liked the constant discharge of the device. You can pretty well estimate over time how much more the smartphone will last you at, say, 32 percent capacity.
        The main role is played not so much by this or that operation, but rather by the screen on time. The longer the display is on, the sooner the device will run out of power. It doesn't matter if you're browsing the internet, social networking apps, photos or fiddling with settings.
        Gaming, photography and shooting videos all contribute more to battery drain. The screenshots show two examples of endurance. In the first case I used the smartphone more sparingly, in the second case more intensively. You can see the difference.
        For example, playing Into The Death 2 consumed 14 percent of the battery capacity in one hour. I had the display brightness set to 50 percent. One hour of watching an HD video on YouTube sliced 9 percent of the battery capacity (brightness 50 percent).
        I didn't use the power saving modes as I want the full potential of the smartphone to be available. But I understand that there are situations where they can be beneficial. The medium power saving mode will extend the battery life by about three to four hours. The strict power saving mode is really strict and limits almost all functions. The extended battery life can be counted in tens of hours.
        Fast charging is excellent. In a few moments you'll have enough power to go somewhere. 10 percent of capacity appears in the notification bar in 7 minutes of charging (from zero capacity). 19 minutes of charging will yield 25 percent of capacity. 41 minutes of charging will yield 50 percent of capacity, and a straight hour on the charger will conjure up 75 percent of capacity.
        I went from 0 to 98 percent in 1 hour and 38 minutes.
        Verdict: The Samsung Galaxy A8 (2018) is an excellent and expensive smartphone in my book, though I did come across a few imperfections. I really like the synergy with the top-end flagship.
        I praise the excellent design and build quality, the excellent display, the software features and the very rich customization options. I give a plus to the upgrade for the front-facing camera and dual SIM design.
        I expected more from the main camera, video quality and low light results. Further, the lack of shutter control bothers me.
        The battery life is among the better average and the 32 GB storage should have been replaced with 64 GB capacity. I respect the memory card though. What bothers me the most, however, is still the price. The retail recommended 499 euros is enough.
        The Samsung Galaxy A8 (2018) will certainly reap ovations with operators, where it can become an attractive business item thanks to subsidies. For fans of the brand, the price will probably not be an issue and those more patient should wait for the price reduction that is sure to come.
        The biggest competition? Considering the price, I can't help but mention the much-praised OnePlus 5T, although it may not be a device from the identical keg.
